# üîÑWhat is Peeky-Blinkers?

For those unfortunate ones with the immense tragedy of owning ultra large or ultra wide monitors, **Peeky-Blinkers** is a windows based ultility app to swap the positions of your running applications in the screen. 
Together with Windows Snap-layout feature it can effectively eliminate the need to move the user's head to the far corners of the screen.  

# ‚öΩFeatures

- Pressing **LEFT SHIFT + RIGHT SHIFT** Swaps the positions of the apps in the anti-clockwise direction
- Pressing **RIGHT SHIFT + LEFT SHIFT** Swaps the positions of the apps in the anti-clockwise direction
- Pressing **LEFT SHIFT + LEFT ALT + RIGHT SHIFT** Shows an overlap on top of running apps which can be mouse clicked to select for the swap
- Its lives in the System Tray menu, which can be opened to view the currently selected running apps
- It preserves the position of the text cursor in the same position regardless of how many apps were swapped 
  
## üçÑ Philosophy

This project is meant to be simple and easy to use. Its not meant to replace **ALT + TAB**. It was simply made to save time when resizing apps based on work priority. 

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Only the non minimised apps can be swapped using Peeky-Blinkers
